# Metamask

Metamask is a popular cryptocurrency wallet and browser extension that allows users to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. It is available as a browser extension for Google Chrome, Firefox, Brave, and Microsoft Edge, as well as a mobile app for iOS and Android devices.

Metamask connects to the Ethereum network through a variety of nodes, including Infura, which is a third-party service that provides access to the Ethereum network, as well as other public and private nodes.

Compared to traditional Ethereum wallets, Metamask does not support certain features such as:

1. Storing tokens from other blockchains: Metamask is primarily designed for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain and does not support storing tokens from other blockchains.
2. Hardware wallet integration: While Metamask allows users to connect to a hardware wallet, it does not fully support hardware wallet integration like some other wallets do.
3. Advanced smart contract functionality: Metamask is primarily focused on providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with the Ethereum network, and as such, it does not support some of the more advanced smart contract features that more technical users may require.

Despite these limitations, Metamask is a powerful and user-friendly tool for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain, and it has become a popular choice for both novice and experienced cryptocurrency users.
